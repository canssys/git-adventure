    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history.</p>
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.</p>
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project).</p>
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
